FCM token or registration tokens) inside a server (in my case it's Node.js) from where you want to send push notifications or by using topics. Isn't possible to just ignore using topics or device tokens and just send notifications by URL name for example '/dashboard'? Because '/dashboard' is a protected route in my app so only the logged in user would be able to receive push notifications. Providing a list of tokens before sending push notifications to devices with these same tokens is cumbersome to be honest. I have to save these tokens to a database (Firestore would be best in my scenario) and I always have to fetch these tokens before sending notifications. And if a user reinstalls the PWA, I have to always replace the old token in the database by a newer one."

"u/Unable_Count_1635","2 days ago","Is it normal that my company fetches development data using JSON mock files ONLY?","So normally in development you'd have a development server with trivial data with a /GET OR /POST API route to test am I right? This is what I am used to but ..when I got hired at my new company.. I noticed that there is no actual /GET OR /POST OR ANY API routes at all. We have NO access to a development server. This application was built in 2007 and so I was told that is the only way they could test data back in the day. When we start on a new feature WE the front end are asked to create a large mock json file so backend can write a script to replicate it..it is so annoying. I feel as though, backend should be coming up with the data sets and not the front end but whatever. Essentially I am reading json responses over http for everything. So you may ask, well how does the data get shown in production? We'll we use /mock.json files (POST req) to (GET & POST OUR DATA..I know weird because technically POST returns data) & in production, we have a java engineer who runs a java .do script that switches our /mock.json over to a real /post API route automatically when he runs his server. I'm sorry. I know this all seems super confusing, well it is because it is. The issue is, that I can never test data in real-time. I have to wait til pre-prod is up & we go back and manually test what went wrong with our mock.json files. Is this normal? (BTW WE HAVE NO UNIT TEST IMPLEMENTATION, WE FETCH MOCK JSON FOR GENERAL USE & NOT UNIT TEST)"

But then i had never received any answer, even though it was confirmed that i would start working in their company, i felt like they basically ghosted me. I started looking elsewhere, so after a small interview I got a new offer. So far this new company has great people, but the catch is I was initially told that they were using angular, but no, it turns out they are still using AngularJS. I was really excited to work for them but knowing that I will be working with a framework that is considered legacy and reading about all the criticism/hate for it Im more nervous than excited."

It seems like even if there's a malicious user using this calculation function 10 times a second, this wouldn't really affect my system, right?
