        "title": "Should I improve my JS?",
        "description": "I started with classic asp and later web forms. Currently I use asp core MVC and after completing some projects I feel the code I write is decent. Obviously I still need to write some JS to make some magic happen on the front end side. I have the feeling my way of writing JS code is not up to date. I use jQuery (with doc ready hook) and define some functions for basic structuring. In some cases I use the onclick attribute of HTML elements to call my JS functions or just put a short jQuery call in it. I use a minifier but of course this doesn't affect my inline script tags. Is this ok or should I improve my JS? If yes, are there any tutorials focusing on writing modern JS code? Any help/opinion much appreciated!\n",

        "description": "I'm developing a webapp that makes use of end-to-end encryption where the client never sends to the server any password. The idea is that the user shouldn't need to trust the server to use my app since all the cryptography and hashing happens on the client.\nMy the idea was to derive a \"master-key\" from the user's password and use it to encrypt any further communication with the server. While the Web Crypto API does a good job at encryption and basic hashing it lacks some form of key derivation algorithm.\nIdeally I'd like to use something like of argon2 to derive my key because that's the de facto best algorithm for the purpose. There are a few WASM ports of it but they don't seem maintained and they don't play nice with the bundler I'm using.\nI was wondering if there's any better approach to my problem and/or better libraries to use\n",

        "description": "Just wanted to draw some attention to this proposal.\nI think it adds useful and important methods to an underappreciated class in JS; a class that is well-suited to handling fairly common tasks. Set is currently little more than a fancy kind of array where all members/items are unique (in the sense). These new methods would make Set more powerful by adding many of the methods found in set theory. Really, without these methods, Sets just aren't sets... Like how numbers aren't really numbers unless you can at least perform basic arithmetic on them. Plus, these methods really simplify a whole lot of common tasks.\nfind all the elements that two lists have in common... set.intersection()\njoin two lists without duplicates... set.union()\nfind the elements in one list that aren't in this other list... set.difference()\nfind the elements in one list or the other, but not both... set.symmetricDifference()\nis every element in one list also contained in another list... set.isSubsestOf() or set.isSupersetOf()\ndo two lists share no elements in common... set.isDisjointFrom()\nThe proposal seems to have been last discussed over 3.5 years ago, and just want to get it rolling again. So lI'm posting this in an effort to draw attention to the proposal.\n",
