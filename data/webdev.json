        "description": "Hi there, is there any way to accomplish something like this easily in Chrome?\nI\u2019m automating something for my company which requires scraping the page with webdriver. Unfortunately, this webpage was designed 15 years ago using a god awful 20+ varying level nested assortment of tables tr, td, hidden elements, blank html table td\u2019s, and unclassed no id elements, all of which have massive lists of obsolete attributes and the like. There are probably around 100 different datapoints that I need to retrieve, and it\u2019s almost impossible to actually follow the tree without getting lost.\nI can whip up something to strip all attributes and keep the values, making it easier to understand all the nesting, but surely there\u2019s a tool or option out there to just make it easier on the eyes for a very intense html page?\nEdit: In case it wasn\u2019t clear, I\u2019m just trying to make it easier to get my locators right. Not exaggerating when I say a locator might need to be some xpath the likes of \u201c//tr[17]/td[23]/label[3]/a[2]\u201d. Yes it\u2019s structured like that, I could never tell you why.\nThanks in advance!\n",

I was a web dev 3 yeras ago and worked mostly with php (wordpress, laravel, symfony...) but I don't know what's the tendency nowadays.\nI want to build a cms website, the frontend could be totally made from scratch so I don't really want to fight with templates like in wp, easily maintanable through time so it has to be very stable and have a great support community so I don't have to beg for help any time I have a problem. It will host a great amount of media, videos and pictures of great quality.\nIs there a stack you can recommend me using or which is the most popular in these days among devs? No problem on technologies, it will be a personal project so I can learn about technologies I'm not used to.\n\nEDIT: I don't need it to be php, it was only the technology I used 3-4 years ago...But I can work with node/angular/any-js. c# or python...I want the most used/most reliable nowadays.\n",

I'm currently using symfony but I've seen that a lot of frameworks work in the same way: each time a request is done from a client, a lot of objects are created to manage the request and to send a response to the client, which means that when there are no clients doing requests, nothing happens server side. My question is as follow: how you do a dynamic webserver (I mean by dynamic, that things can happen even when there are no client requests, like for example changing values in database,...)?? Sorry for my bad English, I tried to describe my question the best I could.\n",
